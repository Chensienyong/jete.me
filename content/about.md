<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

I’m just another boy who likes **programming**, **writing** and **making stuff**. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.

Recently I've also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are!

That’s all that I can think of right now. Hopefully I’ll add something more to this later on. :sweat_smile:
