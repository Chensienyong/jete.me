Recently I've encounter a good video about digital minimalism on internet, [Nathaniel Drew's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdWRLq10OHuy7HmSckV3Vg) which I'm so intrigued by it.

So recently I have a shit ton of work to be done, while maintaining my own project of becoming my better self. There's one issue that always pop-up, **noises**. Noises such as emails, chat messages, social medias and phone calls. The solution is pretty easy actually, just shut it all down and focus on what need to be done. However, goddamn it was super hard, since I have high curiosity and want to know what happening.
