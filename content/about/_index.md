<i>Heyoo there</i>, my name is
<h3 style="letter-spacing:2px"><span style="color:grey">Jeffry</span> Tandiono</h3>
I’m a 25 year old enthusiastic software engineer with five years of experiences from university, agency and start up company. Specialising in back end, web design, some design architecture and experimental testing.

I never intend to fall to the life of engineering.
But over the years I have found a new love for anything engineering and making stuffs easy to use.

I’m currently working at <a href="https://www.bukalapak.com">Bukalapak</a>, as a software engineer. Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege to work on some fantastic projects.

However, when I’m not behind a pc, you could find me either playing a game or watching a movie.

Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me here.
